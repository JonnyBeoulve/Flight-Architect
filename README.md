# Flight Architect
This React app will serve as an interactive element of my Flight website, allowing users to select a private spaceflight package and customize their capsule experience with a variety of selections prior to launch.

## How to Use

## Programming

## Notes
This project just began development. My goal is to create a user friendly experience that will visually display options selected by the user. This idea was inspired by "build a car" style functionality on some car websites.
